        I graduated with a diploma in Hospitality Management in 2020. However, Covid came and I got laid off. Thus, I decide to change my career and believe that IT is more stable and suitable for me.

        I am considered to be honest and sometimes blunt. In group work, I am responsible and put hard effort to create the best project I can do.

        My hobbies is to eat and watch food video. Before pandemic came, I usually dined out with my friends. I have tried many great Chinese, Korean, Japansese and Vietnamese restaurants. I hope to try more cuisines such as African, Indian, Meditarrenan cuisines.
